# Code to analyse the networks (previously saved) using STRING
# It requieres 3 arguments:
# 1) Name (including path) which will be used to load the files (it needs to be the same as in generate_sdcor_GCN.R)
# 2) Path to STRING data with the proper format (see STRING_format.R)

# This code saves and plots the results of the evaluation using STRING
